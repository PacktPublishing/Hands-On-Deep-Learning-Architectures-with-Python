**Create deep neural networks to solve computational problems using TensorFlow and Keras**

## What is this book about?
Deep learning architectures are composed of multilevel nonlinear operations that represent high-level abstractions; this allows you to learn useful feature representations from the data. This book will help you learn and implement deep learning architectures to resolve various deep learning research problems.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Implement CNNs, RNNs, and other commonly used architectures with Python
* Explore architectures such as VGGNet, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet
* Build deep learning architectures for AI applications such as face and image recognition, fraud detection, and many more
* Understand the architectures and applications of Boltzmann machines and autoencoders with concrete examples 
* Master artificial intelligence and neural network concepts and apply them to your architecture
